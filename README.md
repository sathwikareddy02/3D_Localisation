# Real-Time 3D Localization Algorithm for Mobile Robots

This project presents a real-time 3D localization algorithm that enables precise positioning of mobile robots within indoor environments. The solution leverages a multi-camera sensor system and serves as a robust alternative to GPS tracking, effectively addressing localization challenges in obstructed environments.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time 3D Localization**: The algorithm provides real-time positioning of mobile robots in indoor environments. This is particularly useful in environments where GPS signals are weak or non-existent.

- **Multi-Camera Sensor System**: The system utilizes multiple cameras to capture the environment from different viewpoints, enhancing the accuracy of the localization.

- **Robust Alternative to GPS**: The solution offers a reliable alternative to GPS tracking, making it suitable for use in obstructed environments where GPS signals may be unreliable or unavailable.

- **Synchronized PyBullet Simulation**: The project includes a synchronized PyBullet simulation, which seamlessly fuses 2D image coordinates from multiple viewpoints. This feature enhances the project's real-world viability by achieving successful simulation-to-real transfer.
